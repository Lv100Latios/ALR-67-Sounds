# ALR-67-Sounds
This is a pack of recreated sounds from the ALR-67 RWR suite.

These sounds were recreated with a wave generator using a History Channel documentary uploaded to youtube found here: https://youtu.be/Mn1sBfIlUjY?t=2117.
The Lock Warning sound was my best guess since I did not catch the sound being played on the video, but the video is my primary source for creating the rest of the tones.

Use them how you want as long as you conform to the MIT license.
